### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- To ensure my code is functional I use the JUnit5 testing suite to validate that the program meets the specifications outlined in the functional requirements sheet. For security I follow Java's best practices, such as encapsulating sensitive data, input validation, and minimizing exposure of internal methods. I also aim to reduce the risk of errors by following core OOP methods using clean, modular OOP design.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- I begin by communication with users and stakeholders to understand their goals and expectations with the project. I then try to translate their needs into clear requirements using tools like user stories or wireframe when appropriate to get their ideas on paper. If I encounter technical limitations I explain the constraints that exist and work with the users to find feasible alternatives that still address the core of their needs. 
  
### How do I approach designing software?
- My approach to software design starts with defining the product vision and identifying key use cases. I evaluate potential tech stacks I want to use based on project requirements and trade-offs. Once this is done I build a prototype to test the core concept. From there I create a detailed development roadmap, breaking down features into milestones and iteratively improving upon the design based on testing and feedback.
